Here's the idea I had for the card:

Here's the story of the set:

# Brainstorming
    
First, I want you to brainstorm some ideas for the flavor text. I'm not sure what the flavor text should be, so write out ideas in these styles:
* A quote attributed to character in the story about the card, like: "A quotation here" -- [Character Name]
* Poetry relevant to the card
* Something humorous
* Reference to another part of the story
* A single line describing a pivotal moment in the story
* A shocking reveal from the story
* A quote from the character that illustrates their personality, like "A quotation here" -- [Character Name]
* A paragraph that narrates a surprising action like betrayal or sacrifice
{more_len_advice}
Because of the rules on the card, we only have about {lines_guide} of text or {lines_remaining_for_flavor * 40} characters to work with. So {len_advice}. Don't use quotation marks unless it's a quote from a character in the story.

# Final Flavor

Now, I want you to think about these options and choose one that best fits the theme and feeling of the card. Write out the flavor text for this card. It should be {lines_guide} of text that evokes the flavor of the card. So {len_advice}.

Please write the flavor text on its own line, like this (no quotation marks unless it's a quote from a character in the story):
    
Flavor: [flavor text here]"""
