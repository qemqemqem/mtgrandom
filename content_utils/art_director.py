    prompt = f"""I'm generating art for a Magic the Gathering card. 

The details of the card are:
Name: {name}
Flavor Text: {flavor}
Mechanics: {mechanics}
Type: {type_line}

I'd like help generating a prompt to use to create art. First, I'd like you to brainstorm some options, and then I'd like you to write a prompt. 

The final prompt needs to be relatively short, so we'll brainstorm first and then distill it into a short prompt. 

Please fill out this form:

# Brainstorming

Central Figure: Describe what the card might feature
Character Details: If the card features a person, list some details about them. What ethnicity are they? What are they wearing? What is their expression?
Action: What action or event could we depict on the card? Ideally this should suggest tension or arouse the viewer's curiosity
Background Details: What is the setting of the scene? What is the lighting like? What is the weather like? 
Culture: What cultural influences are present? If it is not a traditional Western culture, how can we prompt the artist to depict it in a way that is not stereotypical?
Style: List several stylistic influences we might choose
Medium: List several words to describe the visual medium
Artist: List several artists, living or dead, who might be appropriate to emulate for this art. Suggest at least one artist who has not worked with MTG before. 

(Some of the other cards are in the style of: {', '.join(inspiration)})

# Decision

From the options that you've brainstormed, loosely describe the card art. Try to think of a way in which the scene will be exciting or memorable. Don't be afraid to make bold visual choices to ensure a beautiful card. How can the description convey the cultural influences in a distinctive way?

# Prompt

Final Prompt: \"[Card Name], Magic the Gathering art, spec art, [list several adjectives], [describe the scene in one sentence or less], in the style of [style], [visual medium], by [artist name]\"

Artist Credit: [artist name], [second artist, if more than one]"""
