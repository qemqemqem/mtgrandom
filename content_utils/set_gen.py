    prompt = f"""I'm an employee at Wizards of the Coast and I'm designing a new set of Magic: The Gathering cards.

The theme of the set is: {args.set_description}

To start with, let's describe some possible mechanics that this set might employ. First, brainstorm a brief list of 10 existing mechanics that might be appropriate for the setting. In one sentence or less, explain what the mechanic means.

Then, for each of those possible mechanics, describe a previous Magic the Gathering set that has used that mechanic. Describe how they used that mechanic, and what made it fun to draft and play.

Then describe some of the common mechanics that show up in Magic core sets, like flying or creature type synergies, and how they might be used in this set. You don't need to discuss all of them, but mention anything that you think is particularly relevant to the theme.

Then briefly speculate on 10 synergies or deck archetypes that the set might feature. Focus your description on the gameplay aspect here. For each synergy or archetype, describe how it played in a previous set. I want this to be a strong draft set, so focus your analysis on how these synergies and archetypes will play in draft.

Restrictions: No double sided cards such as werewolfs, no cards that transform, no cards that have a different back.

Next, please discuss how different themes and mechanics will be distributed on the Magic color pie, because we want the set to be balanced across colors. Write one line for each of the five colors describing their theme and mechanics.

Then, write one sentence giving guidance for each of the ten two-color pairs. I want each pair of colors to have a direction during the draft. That might be a mechanic like graveyard synergies, +1/+1 counters, "spells matter" or vehicles. These directions will help us design the cards.

If this set idea reminds you of any existing cards, please mention them, but be brief."""

# Story

First, please write out the story of the setting. If the theme is historical or mythological, please draw heavily from the source material. If the theme is original, please write a story that is consistent with the theme. Be sure to mention the roles of common people and more ordinary participants, including lesser monsters, in addition to the the story of the heroes. Try to include an even mixture of men and women characters. Please write at least 500 words, but feel free to write more if you want to.

# Elements

Looking at the story, I'd like to identify possible cards. A card could represent one of these things:
* A named character
* A background character or group, like the people of a village or something like that
* An artifact or object
* A location
* A monster or creature
* An event or important action
* Significant cultural or magical phenomena

# List of Elements

Please list {args.set_size * 2} elements that you think would make good cards. Please include a fair number of less exciting elements, because we need a lot of commons.

Write the name of each one on a separate line starting with a *. """
