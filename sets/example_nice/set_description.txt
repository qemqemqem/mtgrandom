Thematic Guidance:

This set should evoke a sense of wonder and playfulness, with a touch of mystery. The enchanted forest is a place of magic and beauty, where faeries flit among the trees and strange, fantastical creatures roam. The forest itself is alive, with trees that move and whisper secrets to those who listen. The set should have a light-hearted tone, but also a sense of depth and complexity. The mechanics should reflect the themes of nature, community, and enchantment. The creatures should be diverse and interesting, with a mix of familiar forest animals and more fantastical beings. The art should be vibrant and colorful, with a whimsical, fairy-tale quality.
