Thematic Guidance:

The set should evoke the rich and diverse cultures of the Pacific, with a strong emphasis on the natural world and the elements. The mechanics should reflect the themes of exploration, navigation, and the worship of gods and spirits. The set should also capture the harshness of the landscapes, the power of the sea, and the majesty of the volcanoes. The creatures of the set should be inspired by the unique fauna of the region, as well as the mythical creatures from the folklore of these cultures. The set should also reflect the values of these cultures, such as community, respect for nature, and the importance of knowledge and skill in navigation.
