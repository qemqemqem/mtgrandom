**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Polynesian Deity",
    "supertype": "Legendary Creature",
    "subtype": "God",
    "power": "6",
    "toughness": "6",
    "rule_text": "Islandwalk\nWhen Polynesian Deity enters the battlefield, return target creature to its owner's hand.\nWhenever Polynesian Deity attacks, you may return target creature defending player controls to its owner's hand.",
    "flavor_text": "The sea obeys its command, and the creatures of the deep are its playthings.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{U}{U}{U}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Polynesian Deity" include "Aetherling" and "Kederekt Leviathan". Both have abilities related to manipulating creatures on the battlefield, similar to the Deity's ability to return creatures to their owner's hand.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power and toughness, and all necessary information for a creature card.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says. The abilities are clear and follow the rules of the game.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. The abilities are written in the style of Oracle text, and a judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: 5. The card is very strong. It has a high power and toughness, and its abilities can significantly disrupt the opponent's board state. However, its high mana cost balances it out somewhat.

* Complexity: 4. The card is complex, but not overly so. It has multiple abilities that interact with the game in different ways, but they are straightforward and easy to understand.

* Flavor: 4. The card has a strong flavor that matches its mechanics. The idea of a sea deity that can control creatures and the sea (represented by Islandwalk) is well reflected in its abilities. However, the connection to Polynesian mythology could be made clearer in the flavor text.

Overall, the card "Polynesian Deity" looks good. It is a strong, complex, and flavorful card that fits well within the game's rules and style.
