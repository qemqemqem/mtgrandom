**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Volcanic Ritual",
    "supertype": "Sorcery",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.\nTarget player loses life equal to the sacrificed creature's power.\nIf the sacrificed creature was a Demon, draw a card.",
    "flavor_text": "The volcano's fury, channeled through the fallen.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{B}",
    "rarity": "Uncommon"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Volcanic Ritual" include "Bone Splinters" and "Altar's Reap", both of which involve sacrificing a creature as an additional cost for a beneficial effect.

* The card is not missing any important details. As a sorcery, it doesn't need power or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 3. It's not particularly strong or weak, but it does require a creature to be sacrificed, which can be a significant cost. The potential to draw a card if the sacrificed creature is a Demon adds some versatility and potential power, but it's situational.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 2. It's not overly complex, but the additional cost and conditional card draw add some depth.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The theme of a volcanic ritual involving a sacrifice is well reflected in the mechanics of sacrificing a creature for an effect. The additional bonus if the creature is a Demon adds to the dark, sacrificial flavor.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's well-designed and balanced, with a clear theme that is reflected in its mechanics.
