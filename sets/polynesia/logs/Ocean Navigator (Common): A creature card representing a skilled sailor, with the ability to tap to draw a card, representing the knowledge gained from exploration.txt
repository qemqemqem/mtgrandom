**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Ocean Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor, with the ability to tap to draw a card, representing the knowledge gained from exploration. (blue card)

# Set Mechanics

Blue: Focuses on knowledge and manipulation. Mechanics include Explore and Islandwalk.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Ocean Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor, with the ability to tap to draw a card, representing the knowledge gained from exploration. (blue card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. "Ocean Navigator has Islandwalk." Similar to Merfolk of the Pearl Trident. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 3.
2. "Ocean Navigator can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island." Similar to Scourge of Fleets. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
3. "Ocean Navigator has Hexproof as long as you control an Island." Similar to Slippery Scoundrel. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
4. "Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island." Similar to Lord of Atlantis. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
5. "Ocean Navigator has Flying as long as you control an Island." Similar to Windrider Eel. Complexity 2. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

1. "When Ocean Navigator enters the battlefield, scry 1." Similar to Omenspeaker. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
2. "When Ocean Navigator deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card." Similar to Thieving Magpie. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
3. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control an Island, draw a card." Similar to Arcanis the Omnipotent. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
4. "When Ocean Navigator becomes tapped, you may reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, put it into your hand." Similar to Coiling Oracle. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
5. "Ocean Navigator can't be blocked by creatures with power less than the number of Islands you control." Similar to Serpent of Yawning Depths. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

I need help generating a Magic the Gathering card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Ocean Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor, with the ability to tap to draw a card, representing the knowledge gained from exploration. (blue card)

Here's what its colors are like in the set:

Blue: Focuses on knowledge and manipulation. Mechanics include Explore and Islandwalk.


# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"Ocean Navigator has Islandwalk." Similar to Merfolk of the Pearl Trident. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 3.
"Ocean Navigator can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island." Similar to Scourge of Fleets. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"Ocean Navigator has Hexproof as long as you control an Island." Similar to Slippery Scoundrel. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
"Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island." Similar to Lord of Atlantis. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"Ocean Navigator has Flying as long as you control an Island." Similar to Windrider Eel. Complexity 2. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.
"When Ocean Navigator enters the battlefield, scry 1." Similar to Omenspeaker. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"When Ocean Navigator deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card." Similar to Thieving Magpie. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control an Island, draw a card." Similar to Arcanis the Omnipotent. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"When Ocean Navigator becomes tapped, you may reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, put it into your hand." Similar to Coiling Oracle. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
"Ocean Navigator can't be blocked by creatures with power less than the number of Islands you control." Similar to Serpent of Yawning Depths. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island
Ocean Navigator has Islandwalk

Design Idea2.
Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island
Ocean Navigator has Islandwalk

Design Idea3.
When Ocean Navigator deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Ocean Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor, with the ability to tap to draw a card, representing the knowledge gained from exploration. (blue card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: Ocean Navigator
Card Type: Creature - Human Sailor
Rarity: Common
Mana Cost: 2 Blue
Power/Toughness: 2/2

Mechanics:
1. "Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island." This mechanic is simple and synergistic with the blue color identity, which is often associated with Islands. It also represents the sailor's increased strength and knowledge when navigating familiar waters. Complexity 1, Flavor 4, Synergy 3.
2. "When Ocean Navigator deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card." This mechanic represents the knowledge gained from exploration and fits well with the blue color's focus on card draw and knowledge. It also encourages an aggressive playstyle, which can be a fun challenge in a typically more control-oriented color. Complexity 3, Flavor 5, Synergy 5.

Flavor Text: "The sea whispers secrets to those who know how to listen."

This design is synergistic because it encourages players to control Islands and to attack with Ocean Navigator. The card draw mechanic rewards players for successful attacks, which can be facilitated by the power/toughness boost from controlling an Island. The mechanics are also flavorful and represent the concept of a skilled, knowledge-seeking sailor. The total complexity is 4, which is slightly above your desired maximum, but the mechanics are straightforward and should be easy to understand for most players.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
