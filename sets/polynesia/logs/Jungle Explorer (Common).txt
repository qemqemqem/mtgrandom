**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Jungle Explorer (Common): A creature card that gains a +1/+1 counter each time a land enters the battlefield under your control, representing the growth and resilience of the explorer as they navigate the dense jungle. (green card)

# Set Mechanics

Green: Focuses on growth and resilience. Mechanics include Landfall and Explore.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Jungle Explorer (Common): A creature card that gains a +1/+1 counter each time a land enters the battlefield under your control, representing the growth and resilience of the explorer as they navigate the dense jungle. (green card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

1. Trample: This creature can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking. Similar to [Rhox]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
2. Reach: This creature can block creatures with flying. Similar to [Giant Spider]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 2.
3. Vigilance: Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap. Similar to [Serra Angel]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
4. Hexproof: This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control. Similar to [Invisible Stalker]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
5. Lifelink: Damage dealt by this creature also causes you to gain that much life. Similar to [Vampire Nighthawk]. Complexity 2. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.

6. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library. Similar to [Sylvan Ranger]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
7. Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life. Similar to [Courser of Kruphix]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
8. When this creature dies, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield. Similar to [Elvish Rejuvenator]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
9. Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, this creature gains indestructible until end of turn. Similar to [Terra Stomper]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
10. Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may have target creature get -1/-1 until end of turn. Similar to [Acidic Slime]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.

I need help generating a Magic the Gathering card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Jungle Explorer (Common): A creature card that gains a +1/+1 counter each time a land enters the battlefield under your control, representing the growth and resilience of the explorer as they navigate the dense jungle. (green card)

Here's what its colors are like in the set:

Green: Focuses on growth and resilience. Mechanics include Landfall and Explore.


# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

Trample: This creature can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking. Similar to [Rhox]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
Reach: This creature can block creatures with flying. Similar to [Giant Spider]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 2.

Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may have target creature get -1/-1 until end of turn. Similar to [Acidic Slime]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
When this creature enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library

Design Idea2.
Vigilance: Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap

Design Idea3.
When this creature dies, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Jungle Explorer (Common): A creature card that gains a +1/+1 counter each time a land enters the battlefield under your control, representing the growth and resilience of the explorer as they navigate the dense jungle. (green card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: Jungle Explorer
Type: Creature - Human Scout
Rarity: Common
Cost: 2G
Power/Toughness: 2/2
Color: Green

Mechanics:

1. Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Jungle Explorer. (Complexity 1, Flavor 5, Synergy 5)

2. When Jungle Explorer enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library. (Complexity 3, Flavor 5, Synergy 5)

Flavor Text: "Every step into the unknown strengthens my resolve."

This design is synergistic because the Landfall mechanic directly interacts with the second ability. When Jungle Explorer enters the battlefield, you get to search for a basic land card. This not only helps you ensure you have a land to play on your next turn, but it also sets up for the Landfall trigger, which will give Jungle Explorer a +1/+1 counter. This represents the explorer's growth and resilience as they navigate the dense jungle, perfectly aligning with the flavor of the card. The total complexity is 4, but for a common card with such strong synergy and flavor, it should be acceptable.

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Jungle Explorer (Common): A creature card that gains a +1/+1 counter each time a land enters the battlefield under your control, representing the growth and resilience of the explorer as they navigate the dense jungle. (green card)

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Card Name: Jungle Explorer
Type: Creature - Human Scout
Rarity: Common

Power/Toughness: 2/2
Color: Green

Mechanics:

1. Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Jungle Explorer. (Complexity 1, Flavor 5, Synergy 5)

2. When Jungle Explorer enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library. (Complexity 3, Flavor 5, Synergy 5)

Flavor Text: "Every step into the unknown strengthens my resolve."

The total complexity is 4, but for a common card with such strong synergy and flavor, it should be acceptable.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
