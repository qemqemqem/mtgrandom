**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcanic Ritual (Uncommon): A sorcery card depicting a dangerous ritual performed on the edge of a volcano, giving you the ability to sacrifice a creature for direct damage to a target. (black card)

# Set Mechanics

Black: Focuses on power and rebirth. Mechanics include Evoke and Devotion.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: Volcanic Ritual (Uncommon): A sorcery card depicting a dangerous ritual performed on the edge of a volcano, giving you the ability to sacrifice a creature for direct damage to a target. (black card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics (Complexity 1-2):

1. "As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature." Similar to [Altar's Reap]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
2. "This spell can't be countered." Similar to [Abrupt Decay]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
3. "If a creature was sacrificed this turn, this spell costs 2 less to cast." Similar to [Bone Splinters]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.

Medium Complexity Mechanics (Complexity 2-4):

6. "If the sacrificed creature had power 4 or greater, this spell deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Ferocious]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
7. "If this spell is in your graveyard, you may exile a creature card from your graveyard rather than pay its mana cost." Similar to [Unearth]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
8. "If a creature died this turn, you may cast this spell as though it had flash." Similar to [Morbid]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
9. "When you cast this spell, if it was kicked, it deals double the damage." Similar to [Kicker]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
10. "If the sacrificed creature was a token, create a token that's a copy of it." Similar to [Mimic Vat]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.

Complex Mechanics (Complexity 4-5):

11. "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may pay any amount of life. This spell deals that much additional damage." Similar to [Fire Covenant]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
12. "If a creature was sacrificed this turn, you may cast this spell from your graveyard. If you do, exile it." Similar to [Flashback]. Complexity 5. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
13. "If the sacrificed creature had a death trigger, you may copy that trigger." Similar to [Panharmonicon]. Complexity 5. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
14. "If the sacrificed creature was a Demon, you may return a Demon card from your graveyard to your hand." Similar to [Liliana's Contract]. Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
15. "If the sacrificed creature had power 5 or greater, this spell deals damage equal to that creature's power to each opponent." Similar to [Fling]. Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.

# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature." Similar to [Altar's Reap]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"This spell can't be countered." Similar to [Abrupt Decay]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature
If the sacrificed creature was a token, create a token that's a copy of it

Design Idea2.
If the sacrificed creature had power 5 or greater, this spell deals damage equal to that creature's power to each opponent

Design Idea3.
As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature
When you cast this spell, if it was kicked, it deals double the damage



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 5.

Again, the card idea is: Volcanic Ritual (Uncommon): A sorcery card depicting a dangerous ritual performed on the edge of a volcano, giving you the ability to sacrifice a creature for direct damage to a target. (black card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Volcanic Ritual (Uncommon)

Cost: 2 Black Mana

Type: Sorcery

Text: 

1. "As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature."
2. "Target player loses life equal to the sacrificed creature's power."
3. "If the sacrificed creature was a Demon, draw a card."

Explanation:

This design is synergistic because it combines the sacrifice mechanic, which is a staple of black magic, with the ability to deal direct damage based on the sacrificed creature's power, which is a common mechanic in black and red magic. This combination allows for strategic gameplay, as players can choose to sacrifice a powerful creature for maximum damage, or a weaker creature if they need to conserve their forces.

The third mechanic, drawing a card if the sacrificed creature was a Demon, adds an extra layer of strategy and synergy. It encourages players to use Demon creatures, which are a common creature type in black magic, and rewards them for doing so. This mechanic also helps to mitigate the card disadvantage of sacrificing a creature by allowing the player to draw a new card.

This design has a total complexity of 4 (1 for the sacrifice mechanic, 2 for the damage mechanic, and 1 for the Demon mechanic), which is within the limit of 5. It also fits well with the flavor of a dangerous volcanic ritual, as the player is essentially throwing a creature into the volcano to deal damage to their opponent.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
