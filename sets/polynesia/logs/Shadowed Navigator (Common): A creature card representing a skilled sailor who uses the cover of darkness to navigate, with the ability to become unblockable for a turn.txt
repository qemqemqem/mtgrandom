**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Shadowed Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate, with the ability to become unblockable for a turn. (black card)

# Set Mechanics

Black: Focuses on power and rebirth. Mechanics include Evoke and Devotion.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Shadowed Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate, with the ability to become unblockable for a turn. (black card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. "Shadowed Navigator has Menace." Similar to [Goblin War Drums]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
2. "When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card." Similar to [Liliana's Reaver]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
3. "Shadowed Navigator has Deathtouch." Similar to [Vampire Nighthawk]. Complexity 1. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.
4. "At the beginning of your upkeep, lose 1 life and draw a card." Similar to [Phyrexian Arena]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
5. "When Shadowed Navigator dies, return it to its owner's hand." Similar to [Gravedigger]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

6. "Pay 2 life: Shadowed Navigator gains unblockable until end of turn." Similar to [Invisible Stalker]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
7. "When Shadowed Navigator enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Dusk Legion Zealot]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
8. "Whenever a creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Shadowed Navigator." Similar to [Blood Artist]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
9. "At the beginning of your end step, if an opponent lost life this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Shadowed Navigator." Similar to [Vampire Neonate]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
10. "When Shadowed Navigator enters the battlefield, target creature an opponent controls gets -1/-1 until end of turn." Similar to [Foulmire Knight]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

I need help generating a Magic the Gathering card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Shadowed Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate, with the ability to become unblockable for a turn. (black card)

Here's what its colors are like in the set:

Black: Focuses on power and rebirth. Mechanics include Evoke and Devotion.


# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"Shadowed Navigator has Menace." Similar to [Goblin War Drums]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
"When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card." Similar to [Liliana's Reaver]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"Shadowed Navigator has Deathtouch." Similar to [Vampire Nighthawk]. Complexity 1. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.
"At the beginning of your upkeep, lose 1 life and draw a card." Similar to [Phyrexian Arena]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When Shadowed Navigator dies, return it to its owner's hand." Similar to [Gravedigger]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
"Pay 2 life: Shadowed Navigator gains unblockable until end of turn." Similar to [Invisible Stalker]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
"When Shadowed Navigator enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Dusk Legion Zealot]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"Whenever a creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Shadowed Navigator." Similar to [Blood Artist]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"At the beginning of your end step, if an opponent lost life this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Shadowed Navigator." Similar to [Vampire Neonate]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"When Shadowed Navigator enters the battlefield, target creature an opponent controls gets -1/-1 until end of turn." Similar to [Foulmire Knight]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
When Shadowed Navigator enters the battlefield, target creature an opponent controls gets -1/-1 until end of turn

Design Idea2.
When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card

Design Idea3.
When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Shadowed Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate, with the ability to become unblockable for a turn. (black card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Shadowed Navigator
Creature - Human Pirate
2/2

"Pay 2 life: Shadowed Navigator gains unblockable until end of turn."
"When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card."

This design is synergistic because it combines the navigator's ability to move unseen (represented by the unblockable mechanic) with the disruptive effects of his stealthy attacks (represented by the discard mechanic). The unblockable mechanic ensures that the navigator can deal damage to the opponent, triggering the discard effect. This combination of mechanics is also flavorful, as it captures the idea of a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate and disrupt his enemies. The complexity of this design is 3, which is within the limit you set. The use of life as a resource to activate the unblockable ability also fits with the black color's focus on power at any cost.

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Shadowed Navigator (Common): A creature card representing a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate, with the ability to become unblockable for a turn. (black card)

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Shadowed Navigator
Creature - Human Pirate
2/2

"Pay 2 life: Shadowed Navigator gains unblockable until end of turn."
"When Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card."

This design is synergistic because it combines the navigator's ability to move unseen (represented by the unblockable mechanic) with the disruptive effects of his stealthy attacks (represented by the discard mechanic). The unblockable mechanic ensures that the navigator can deal damage to the opponent, triggering the discard effect. This combination of mechanics is also flavorful, as it captures the idea of a skilled sailor who uses the cover of darkness to navigate and disrupt his enemies. The complexity of this design is 3, which is within the limit you set. The use of life as a resource to activate the unblockable ability also fits with the black color's focus on power at any cost.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.

** RESPONSE **
