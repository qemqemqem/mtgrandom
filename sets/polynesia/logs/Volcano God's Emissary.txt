**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Volcano God's Emissary",
    "supertype": "Legendary Creature",
    "subtype": "Elemental Shaman",
    "power": "4",
    "toughness": "4",
    "rule_text": "Trample\nWhenever Volcano God's Emissary deals combat damage to a player, you may pay {2}{G}{G}. If you do, create a token that's a copy of a land you control.\nWhenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, Volcano God's Emissary gets +1/+1 until end of turn.",
    "flavor_text": "From the fiery depths, new lands are born.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{G}{G}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Volcano God's Emissary" include "Rampaging Baloths" and "Avenger of Zendikar" due to their landfall abilities and "Bramble Sovereign" for its ability to create copies of creatures, albeit not lands.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: 4. The card is strong, especially in a deck built around landfall or land ramp strategies. However, it requires a significant mana investment to fully utilize its abilities, which balances its power.

* Complexity: 4. The card has multiple abilities that interact with each other and the rest of the game in complex ways. It requires strategic decision-making to use effectively.

* Flavor: 4. The card's flavor text and mechanics match well. The idea of a volcanic entity creating new lands as it rampages is well reflected in the mechanics of creating land tokens and growing stronger with each new land.

Overall, the card "Volcano God's Emissary" looks good. It is a well-designed card that fits within the desired power and complexity levels for a rare card, and its flavor matches its mechanics well.
