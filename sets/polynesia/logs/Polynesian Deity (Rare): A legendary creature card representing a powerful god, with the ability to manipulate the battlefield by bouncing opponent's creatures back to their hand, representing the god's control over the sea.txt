**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Polynesian Deity (Rare): A legendary creature card representing a powerful god, with the ability to manipulate the battlefield by bouncing opponent's creatures back to their hand, representing the god's control over the sea. (blue card)

# Set Mechanics

Blue: Focuses on knowledge and manipulation. Mechanics include Explore and Islandwalk.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: Polynesian Deity (Rare): A legendary creature card representing a powerful god, with the ability to manipulate the battlefield by bouncing opponent's creatures back to their hand, representing the god's control over the sea. (blue card)

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

"Hexproof." Similar to [Invisible Stalker]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Islandwalk
Can't be blocked
Whenever an opponent casts a spell, you may return target creature to its owner's hand

Design Idea2.
When this creature enters the battlefield, return target creature to its owner's hand
Whenever an opponent casts a spell, you may return target creature to its owner's hand

Design Idea3.
Can't be blocked
X: Return target creature with converted mana cost X to its owner's hand



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 7.

Again, the card idea is: Polynesian Deity (Rare): A legendary creature card representing a powerful god, with the ability to manipulate the battlefield by bouncing opponent's creatures back to their hand, representing the god's control over the sea. (blue card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Polynesian Deity (Rare)
Legendary Creature - God
Islandwalk
When this creature enters the battlefield, return target creature to its owner's hand.
Whenever this creature attacks, you may return target creature defending player controls to its owner's hand.

This design is synergistic for several reasons. First, the Islandwalk mechanic represents the god's control over the sea, allowing it to bypass creatures on islands (blue lands) and attack directly. This is a classic blue mechanic that fits well with the Polynesian sea god theme.

Second, the "When this creature enters the battlefield, return target creature to its owner's hand" mechanic represents the god's power to manipulate the battlefield, causing a creature to retreat when it appears. This is a powerful effect that can disrupt the opponent's plans and give you a significant advantage.

Finally, the "Whenever this creature attacks, you may return target creature defending player controls to its owner's hand" mechanic represents the god's ongoing control over the battlefield. Every time it attacks, it can force another creature to retreat. This can clear the way for other creatures to attack, or simply keep the opponent's side of the battlefield clear.

The total complexity of this card is 6 (1 for Islandwalk, 3 for the enter the battlefield effect, and 2 for the attack trigger), which is within the limit of 7. The flavor is strong, representing a powerful sea god that can control the battlefield and disrupt the opponent's plans. The synergy is also high, as all of the mechanics work together to control the battlefield and allow the Polynesian Deity to attack unopposed.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.

** RESPONSE **

```json
{
    "name": "Polynesian Deity",
    "supertype": "Legendary Creature",
    "subtype": "God",
    "power": "6",
    "toughness": "6",
    "rule_text": "Islandwalk\nWhen Polynesian Deity enters the battlefield, return target creature to its owner's hand.\nWhenever Polynesian Deity attacks, you may return target creature defending player controls to its owner's hand.",
    "flavor_text": "The sea obeys its command, and the creatures of the deep are its playthings.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{U}{U}{U}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```
This card represents a powerful sea god with the ability to control the battlefield by forcing creatures to retreat. It has a high power and toughness, reflecting its divine status, and its mana cost is appropriately high. The Islandwalk ability allows it to bypass creatures on islands, representing its control over the sea, and its other abilities allow it to disrupt the opponent's plans and control the battlefield.
