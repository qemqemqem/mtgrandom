**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcano Acolyte (Uncommon): A human monk card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the worship of the volcano gods, providing damage prevention. (white card)

# Set Mechanics

White: Focuses on community and protection. Mechanics include Crew and Devotion.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: Volcano Acolyte (Uncommon): A human monk card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the worship of the volcano gods, providing damage prevention. (white card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Lifelink
Whenever you cast a spell that targets Volcano Acolyte, you gain 1 life

Design Idea2.
Tap, Sacrifice Volcano Acolyte: Prevent all damage a source of your choice would deal this turn  Activate this ability only if your devotion to white is greater than any other color

Design Idea3.
Tap, Sacrifice Volcano Acolyte: Prevent all damage a source of your choice would deal this turn  Activate this ability only if your devotion to white is greater than any other color



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 5.

Again, the card idea is: Volcano Acolyte (Uncommon): A human monk card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the worship of the volcano gods, providing damage prevention. (white card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: Volcano Acolyte

Card Type: Creature - Human Monk

Rarity: Uncommon

Mana Cost: 2 White

Card Text:

- Lifelink (Complexity 1, Flavor 3, Synergy 4)
- "Whenever you cast a spell that targets Volcano Acolyte, you gain 1 life." (Complexity 3, Flavor 3, Synergy 4)
- "Devotion to White — Volcano Acolyte has protection from red as long as your devotion to white is more than your devotion to any other color." (Complexity 5, Flavor 5, Synergy 5)

Power/Toughness: 2/2

Explanation: 

The Lifelink mechanic fits well with the white color's focus on community and protection, as it allows the player to gain life whenever Volcano Acolyte deals damage. This also synergizes well with the second mechanic, which allows the player to gain additional life whenever they cast a spell that targets Volcano Acolyte. 

The Devotion mechanic is used to represent the Acolyte's worship of the volcano gods, providing him with protection from red (the color often associated with fire and volcanoes) as long as the player's devotion to white is greater than any other color. This mechanic adds a layer of strategic depth to the card, as the player will need to carefully manage their devotion to maximize the Acolyte's effectiveness.

Overall, this design provides a good balance of complexity and synergy, while also fitting well with the card's flavor and the overall theme of the set.

Overall, this design provides a good balance of complexity and synergy, while also fitting well with the card's flavor and the overall theme of the set.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
