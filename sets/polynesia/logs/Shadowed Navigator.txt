**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Shadowed Navigator",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Human Pirate",
    "power": "2",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "Pay 2 life: Shadowed Navigator gains unblockable until end of turn.\nWhen Shadowed Navigator deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card.",
    "flavor_text": "Using the cover of darkness, he navigates the seas unseen, leaving chaos in his wake.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{B}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Shadowed Navigator" include "Invisible Stalker" and "Liliana's Specter". Both have unblockable or evasion abilities and cause the opponent to discard cards.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power and toughness, and all necessary rules text.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. Paying life to give a creature unblockable is a common black mechanic, and causing an opponent to discard when dealing damage is also a common black mechanic.

* The card is written in the correct style for MTG. The rules text is clear and a judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around a 3. It's a common card with a strong ability, but the ability comes with a cost that can't be paid indefinitely. It's not overpowered, but it's stronger than a typical common.

* The complexity of the card is around a 2. It has two abilities, but both are straightforward and easy to understand.

* The flavor of the card is a 4. The mechanics of being unblockable and causing discards fit well with the flavor of a stealthy pirate navigating unseen and leaving chaos in his wake.

Overall, the card "Shadowed Navigator" looks good. It's a well-designed common with a good balance of power, complexity, and flavor.

The card art will depict a mysterious figure, cloaked and hidden, navigating through a shadowy, surreal realm. The figure's eyes and a magical compass provide the only sources of light in the otherwise dark scene. The compass and cloak bear designs inspired by Celtic or Norse mythology, hinting at a culture of exploration and navigation.
