**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Spirit of the Sea",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Spirit",
    "power": "2",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "Islandwalk (This creature can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island.)\nWhen Spirit of the Sea deals combat damage to a player, you may reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, put it onto the battlefield. Otherwise, put it into your hand.\nFlash (You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.)",
    "flavor_text": "The sea holds many secrets, and the Spirit of the Sea knows them all.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{U}{U}",
    "rarity": "Uncommon"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Spirit of the Sea" include "Aether Adept" for its flash ability and "Invisible Stalker" for its unblockable ability. The land-fetching ability is reminiscent of "Oracle of Mul Daya", though the latter is more powerful and consistent.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power and toughness, and all necessary rules text.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 3.5. It has a decent body for its cost, unblockable under certain conditions, and can potentially provide card advantage or ramp. However, its abilities are somewhat situational and depend on the top card of your library.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 3. It has multiple abilities, but none of them are particularly complex or difficult to understand.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The flavor of a sea spirit that knows all the sea's secrets and can navigate unblocked through islands is well reflected in the mechanics. The ability to reveal and potentially play lands could represent the spirit revealing the sea's hidden treasures.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a solid uncommon with interesting abilities and good flavor.
