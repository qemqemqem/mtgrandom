**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Spirit of the Canopy (Uncommon): A creature card with reach that gains additional power and toughness for each land you control, representing a powerful tree spirit that draws strength from the vastness of the jungle. (green card)

# Set Mechanics

Green: Focuses on growth and resilience. Mechanics include Landfall and Explore.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: Spirit of the Canopy (Uncommon): A creature card with reach that gains additional power and toughness for each land you control, representing a powerful tree spirit that draws strength from the vastness of the jungle. (green card)

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Spirit of the Canopy
Whenever Spirit of the Canopy deals combat damage to a player, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield

Design Idea2.
Vigilance
Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, Spirit of the Canopy fights target creature you don't control

Design Idea3.
Vigilance
Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Spirit of the Canopy
Whenever Spirit of the Canopy deals combat damage to a player, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 5.

Again, the card idea is: Spirit of the Canopy (Uncommon): A creature card with reach that gains additional power and toughness for each land you control, representing a powerful tree spirit that draws strength from the vastness of the jungle. (green card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Spirit of the Canopy

Creature - Spirit (Uncommon)

Reach

Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Spirit of the Canopy.

Whenever Spirit of the Canopy deals combat damage to a player, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.

2/2

This design is synergistic because it combines the Landfall mechanic, which is a staple of green's focus on growth and land interaction, with a mechanic that allows you to put more lands onto the battlefield, further fueling the Landfall ability. The Reach ability represents the creature's connection to the trees and its ability to interact with flying creatures, which is a common trait for green creatures. 

The complexity of this card is 2 (Landfall) + 2 (putting a land card from your hand onto the battlefield) + 1 (Reach) = 5, which is within the limit you set. The synergy is high because the Landfall and putting a land card from your hand onto the battlefield mechanics feed into each other, and both of them are boosted by having more lands. The Reach ability adds a defensive capability to the card, which is in line with green's focus on resilience. 

This design also fits well with the flavor of a powerful tree spirit that draws strength from the vastness of the jungle. The more lands (representing the jungle) you have, the stronger the Spirit of the Canopy becomes. The Reach ability represents the spirit's connection to the trees of the jungle, allowing it to reach into the sky to interact with flying creatures.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
