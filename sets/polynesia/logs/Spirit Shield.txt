**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Spirit Shield",
    "supertype": "Enchantment",
    "subtype": "Aura",
    "rule_text": "Enchant creature\nEnchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each white symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control.\nWhen Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, you gain life equal to your devotion to white.",
    "flavor_text": "The gods' favor is a shield against all harm.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{W}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Spirit Shield" include "Ethereal Armor" and "Nyx-Fleece Ram", both of which interact with the enchantment and devotion mechanics.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness as it's not a creature.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around 3. It's not particularly strong on its own, but in a deck built around white mana symbols and enchantments, it could be quite powerful. 

* The complexity of the card is around 3. It's not overly complex, but understanding how it works requires a good understanding of the devotion and enchantment mechanics.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 4. The idea of a shield granted by the gods that grows stronger with your devotion to them is well reflected in the mechanics.

Overall, the card "Looks good".
