**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Fire Dancer (Common): A creature that gains temporary power boosts whenever you cast a spell, representing the fiery passion of the island's traditional dances. (red card)

# Set Mechanics

Red: Focuses on passion and chaos. Mechanics include Evoke and Mountainwalk.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Fire Dancer (Common): A creature that gains temporary power boosts whenever you cast a spell, representing the fiery passion of the island's traditional dances. (red card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. Haste. Similar to [Goblin Guide]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
   - Haste allows the Fire Dancer to attack immediately, representing the quick and passionate movements of the dance.

2. First Strike. Similar to [Ash Zealot]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 2.
   - First Strike represents the dancer's swift and precise movements, striking before the opponent can react.

3. "Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Kiln Fiend]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
   - This mechanic directly represents the dancer gaining power from the fiery passion of the dance, which is fueled by the casting of spells.

4. "Fire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures." Similar to [Menace]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
   - This represents the dancer's mesmerizing movements making it difficult for a single creature to block.

5. "Whenever Fire Dancer deals combat damage to a player, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Rummaging Goblin]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
   - This represents the chaotic nature of the dance, constantly changing and unpredictable.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

6. "Whenever you cast a spell, if it's the second spell you cast this turn, Fire Dancer gets +2/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Wee Dragonauts]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
   - This mechanic represents the dancer gaining more power as the dance intensifies, fueled by the casting of multiple spells.

7. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have no cards in hand, Fire Dancer gets +3/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Hellbent]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
   - This represents the dancer's passion reaching its peak when there's nothing left to hold back.

8. "Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer deals 1 damage to any target." Similar to [Guttersnipe]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
   - This represents the fiery sparks flying from the dancer with each spell cast, damaging the opponent or their creatures.

9. "Whenever Fire Dancer becomes the target of a spell, it gets +2/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Kiln Fiend]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
   - This represents the dancer's fiery passion flaring up in response to being targeted, becoming more powerful.

10. "Whenever you cast a spell, if that spell has the same name as a card in your graveyard, Fire Dancer gets +3/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Prowess]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 5.
   - This represents the dancer's power increasing as the dance repeats and intensifies, fueled by the casting of the same spell.

I need help generating a Magic the Gathering card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Fire Dancer (Common): A creature that gains temporary power boosts whenever you cast a spell, representing the fiery passion of the island's traditional dances. (red card)

Here's what its colors are like in the set:

Red: Focuses on passion and chaos. Mechanics include Evoke and Mountainwalk.


# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

Haste. Similar to [Goblin Guide]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
First Strike. Similar to [Ash Zealot]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 2.
"Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Kiln Fiend]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"Fire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures." Similar to [Menace]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"Whenever Fire Dancer deals combat damage to a player, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Rummaging Goblin]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"Whenever you cast a spell, if it's the second spell you cast this turn, Fire Dancer gets +2/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Wee Dragonauts]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have no cards in hand, Fire Dancer gets +3/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Hellbent]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer deals 1 damage to any target." Similar to [Guttersnipe]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
"Whenever Fire Dancer becomes the target of a spell, it gets +2/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Kiln Fiend]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"Whenever you cast a spell, if that spell has the same name as a card in your graveyard, Fire Dancer gets +3/+0 until end of turn." Similar to [Prowess]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 5.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer deals 1 damage to any target

Design Idea2.
First Strike
Fire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures

Design Idea3.
Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Fire Dancer (Common): A creature that gains temporary power boosts whenever you cast a spell, representing the fiery passion of the island's traditional dances. (red card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Fire Dancer
Creature - Human Shaman
Common

"Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn."
"Fire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures."

Power/Toughness: 1/3

The design I've chosen is synergistic because it combines the fiery passion of the Fire Dancer with the chaos and unpredictability of the red color. The mechanic "Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn" is a perfect representation of the Fire Dancer's passion and energy, as it gains power with each spell you cast, symbolizing the increasing intensity of the dance. This mechanic also encourages an aggressive, spell-heavy playstyle, which is in line with the red color's focus on passion and chaos.

The second mechanic, "Fire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures", adds an element of chaos and unpredictability to the card. It makes the Fire Dancer a difficult creature to deal with, as it requires the opponent to have multiple creatures on the field to block it. This mechanic also synergizes well with the first mechanic, as the power boost from casting spells can make the Fire Dancer a significant threat that can't be easily blocked.

The total complexity of this card is 2, which is within the limit of 3. The first mechanic has a complexity of 2, and the second mechanic has a complexity of 1. This makes the card simple enough for new players to understand, while still offering interesting gameplay decisions for more experienced players.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
