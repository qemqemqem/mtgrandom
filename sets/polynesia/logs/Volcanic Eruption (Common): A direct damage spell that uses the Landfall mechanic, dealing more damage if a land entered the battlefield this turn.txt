**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcanic Eruption (Common): A direct damage spell that uses the Landfall mechanic, dealing more damage if a land entered the battlefield this turn.  (red card)

# Set Mechanics

Red: Focuses on passion and chaos. Mechanics include Evoke and Mountainwalk.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Volcanic Eruption (Common): A direct damage spell that uses the Landfall mechanic, dealing more damage if a land entered the battlefield this turn.  (red card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

1. "If a mountain entered the battlefield under your control this turn, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
2. "If Volcanic Eruption was kicked, it deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Comet Storm]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
3. "If you control a mountain, Volcanic Eruption can't be countered." Similar to [Rending Volley]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
4. "If you control more mountains than each opponent, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Price of Progress]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
5. "If Volcanic Eruption was cast from your hand, it deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Thunderous Wrath]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.

6. "When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, add {R} to your mana pool." Similar to [Seething Song]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
7. "When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may sacrifice a mountain. If you do, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 3 damage." Similar to [Fireblast]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
8. "When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Faithless Looting]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
9. "When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may exile a card from your graveyard. If you do, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Flame Jab]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
10. "When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may sacrifice a creature. If you do, Volcanic Eruption deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature's power to any target." Similar to [Fling]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"If a mountain entered the battlefield under your control this turn, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"If Volcanic Eruption was kicked, it deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Comet Storm]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"If you control a mountain, Volcanic Eruption can't be countered." Similar to [Rending Volley]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"If you control more mountains than each opponent, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Price of Progress]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"If Volcanic Eruption was cast from your hand, it deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Thunderous Wrath]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 3.

"When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Faithless Looting]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may exile a card from your graveyard. If you do, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage." Similar to [Flame Jab]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
When you cast Volcanic Eruption, if a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you may sacrifice a mountain  If you do, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 3 damage

Design Idea2.
If a mountain entered the battlefield under your control this turn, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage
If you control more mountains than each opponent, Volcanic Eruption deals an additional 2 damage

Design Idea3.
If Volcanic Eruption was kicked, it deals an additional 2 damage
If you control a mountain, Volcanic Eruption can't be countered



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Volcanic Eruption (Common): A direct damage spell that uses the Landfall mechanic, dealing more damage if a land entered the battlefield this turn.  (red card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: Volcanic Eruption

Type: Instant

Rarity: Common

Mana Cost: 1R

Card Text: 
Volcanic Eruption deals 2 damage to any target. 
Landfall — If a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, Volcanic Eruption deals 3 damage to that target instead.

Flavor Text: "The mountain's fury knows no bounds."

Reasoning: 

The Landfall mechanic is simple and fits well with the theme of a volcanic eruption being more powerful when a land (or in this case, a mountain) enters the battlefield. This mechanic also has a good synergy with the red color's focus on chaos and passion, as it encourages an aggressive playstyle of playing lands and casting spells.

The direct damage aspect of the card is also a staple of red cards, and it fits well with the theme of a volcanic eruption. It also has good synergy with the Landfall mechanic, as it rewards the player for playing lands with increased damage.

This design has a complexity of 1, as it only has one additional mechanic beyond dealing damage, and that mechanic is straightforward. It also has a high flavor rating, as the mechanics and theme of the card fit well together. Finally, it has good synergy with the rest of the red color's mechanics and themes in the set, as it encourages an aggressive playstyle and rewards the player for playing lands.

# Final Card

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
