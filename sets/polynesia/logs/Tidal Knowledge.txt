**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Tidal Knowledge",
    "supertype": "Instant",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Scry 2. If you control an Island, draw a card.",
    "flavor_text": "The tides and stars guide those who know how to listen.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{U}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Tidal Knowledge" include "Preordain" and "Serum Visions", both of which allow you to scry and then draw a card.

* The card is not missing any important details. As an instant, it doesn't need power or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 2. It's a decent common, but not particularly strong. It's a bit better if you control an Island, but it's not going to swing a game on its own.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 1. It's very simple, with only two effects that are easy to understand.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The flavor text and the mechanics match well. The idea of gaining knowledge (represented by scrying and drawing cards) from the tides (represented by the Island requirement) is a nice touch.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a solid common that would fit well in a blue deck, especially one with a focus on card advantage.
