**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Ancestral Fire God",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "God",
    "power": "3",
    "toughness": "3",
    "rule_text": "This creature gets +1/+0 for each red mana symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control. When this creature enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to your devotion to red to any target. At the beginning of your upkeep, if your devotion to red is five or more, Ancestral Fire God deals 5 damage to any target.",
    "flavor_text": "The island's revered deity, a manifestation of fiery wrath, demands unwavering devotion.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{R}{R}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Ancestral Fire God" include "Fanatic of Mogis" and "Purphoros, God of the Forge". Both these cards have abilities that deal damage based on your devotion to red.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power, and toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around a 5. It has the potential to deal a lot of damage, especially in a deck built around red devotion. However, it's not overpowered as it requires a specific deck build and its power and toughness are not exceptionally high for its cost.

* The complexity of the card is around a 4. It has multiple abilities and interactions with other cards, but it's not overly complicated.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 5. The theme of a fiery god demanding devotion is well reflected in the mechanics of dealing damage based on red devotion.

Overall, the card "Looks good".
