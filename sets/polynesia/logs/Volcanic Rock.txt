**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Volcanic Rock",
    "supertype": "Land",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped.\n{T}: Add {C}.\nSacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R}.",
    "flavor_text": "The dormant power of the volcano can erupt into a sudden burst of energy.",
    "mana_cost": "",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Volcanic Rock" include "Crystal Vein" and "Dwarven Ruins". Both are lands that can be sacrificed for additional mana.

* The card is not missing any important details. As a land, it doesn't require a mana cost, and power and toughness are not applicable.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says: it enters the battlefield tapped, can be tapped for colorless mana, or can be sacrificed for two red mana.

* The card is written in the correct style for MTG. The rules text is clear and a judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: 2. The card is not particularly strong or weak. It provides flexibility in mana generation, but the sacrifice requirement limits its long-term utility.

* Complexity: 1. The card is very simple. It has a straightforward mechanic that is easy to understand.

* Flavor: 3. The flavor text and the mechanics match well. The idea of a volcanic rock containing dormant power that can be released is reflected in the ability to sacrifice the land for additional mana.

Overall, the card "Volcanic Rock" looks good. It's a simple, balanced card with a clear mechanic and a fitting flavor.
