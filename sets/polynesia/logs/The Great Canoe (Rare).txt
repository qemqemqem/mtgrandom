Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

The Great Canoe (Rare): A powerful vehicle card with a high crew cost, representing the teamwork and skill needed to navigate the vast oceans. (colorless card)

# Set Mechanics



Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: The Great Canoe (Rare): A powerful vehicle card with a high crew cost, representing the teamwork and skill needed to navigate the vast oceans. (colorless card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"Crew 4" (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn). Similar to [Skysovereign, Consul Flagship]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Menace" (This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures)
When The Great Canoe deals combat damage to a player, you may exile target nonland permanent that player controls"
Whenever The Great Canoe becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each creature blocking it"

Design Idea2.
The Great Canoe can't be blocked as long as it's attacking alone"
At the beginning of your upkeep, if The Great Canoe is crewed, reveal the top card of your library  If it's a land card, put it onto the battlefield  Otherwise, put it into your hand"

Design Idea3.
Crew 4" (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn)
Whenever The Great Canoe becomes blocked, it gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each creature blocking it"
The Great Canoe can't be blocked as long as it's attacking alone"



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 7.

Again, the card idea is: The Great Canoe (Rare): A powerful vehicle card with a high crew cost, representing the teamwork and skill needed to navigate the vast oceans. (colorless card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

The Great Canoe (Rare)
Vehicle Artifact
Crew 4 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn)
Whenever The Great Canoe becomes crewed, draw a card.
Whenever The Great Canoe deals combat damage to a player, you may exile target nonland permanent that player controls.
Power/Toughness: 5/5

This design is synergistic because it encourages the player to crew The Great Canoe often, rewarding them with card draw each time. This can help the player maintain a steady flow of creatures to meet the high crew cost. The ability to exile a nonland permanent when dealing combat damage provides a strong incentive to attack with The Great Canoe, and the high power and toughness make it a formidable threat. The high crew cost also fits the flavor of a large, powerful vehicle that requires a skilled team to operate. The total complexity is 6 (3 for Crew 4, 3 for the exile ability), which is within the limit.

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

The Great Canoe (Rare): A powerful vehicle card with a high crew cost, representing the teamwork and skill needed to navigate the vast oceans. (colorless card)

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

The Great Canoe (Rare)
Vehicle Artifact
Crew 4 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn)
Whenever The Great Canoe becomes crewed, draw a card.
Whenever The Great Canoe deals combat damage to a player, you may exile target nonland permanent that player controls.
Power/Toughness: 5/5

This can help the player maintain a steady flow of creatures to meet the high crew cost. The ability to exile a nonland permanent when dealing combat damage provides a strong incentive to attack with The Great Canoe, and the high power and toughness make it a formidable threat. The high crew cost also fits the flavor of a large, powerful vehicle that requires a skilled team to operate. The total complexity is 6 (3 for Crew 4, 3 for the exile ability), which is within the limit.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.

** RESPONSE **

    "name": "The Great Canoe",
    "supertype": "Artifact",
    "subtype": "Vehicle",
