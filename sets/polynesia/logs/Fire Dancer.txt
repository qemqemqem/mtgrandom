**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Fire Dancer",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Human Shaman",
    "power": "1",
    "toughness": "3",
    "rule_text": "Whenever you cast a spell, Fire Dancer gets +1/+0 until end of turn.\nFire Dancer can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.",
    "flavor_text": "The fiery passion of the island's traditional dances fuels her power.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{R}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Fire Dancer" include "Wee Dragonauts" and "Kiln Fiend", both of which get a power boost when you cast a spell.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around 2. It's not particularly strong, but it has potential in the right deck. It's a common card, so this falls within the acceptable range.

* The complexity of the card is around 2. It has a couple of abilities, but they're straightforward and easy to understand. This is within the acceptable range for a common card.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is around 4. The idea of a fire dancer getting stronger as you cast spells (presumably representing the dancer's performance getting more intense) is a nice match.

Overall, the card "Fire Dancer" looks good. It's a solid common card with a nice flavor and mechanics that match.

# Decision

The card art will depict a fiery elf or djinn woman, performing a ritualistic fire dance in a dark, rocky landscape. The scene is lit only by her flames, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that contrasts with the dark surroundings. The culture is a blend of Middle Eastern and fantasy, with the dancer's attire and movements reflecting this.
