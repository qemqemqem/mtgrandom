**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Spirit of the Volcano",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Elemental Spirit",
    "power": "4",
    "toughness": "4",
    "rule_text": "Evoke 1RR (You may cast this spell for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.)\nWhen Spirit of the Volcano enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature without flying.\nMountainwalk (This creature can't be blocked as long as defending player controls a Mountain.)",
    "flavor_text": "Its arrival is heralded by the earth's trembling rage, its departure by the silence of the scorched.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{R}{R}",
    "rarity": "Uncommon"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Spirit of the Volcano" include "Ingot Chewer" and "Shriekmaw", both of which have the Evoke mechanic and deal with destruction upon entering the battlefield.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 4. It has a strong effect that can potentially clear the board of non-flying creatures, and it has a reasonable cost for its power and toughness. It also has the flexibility of the Evoke mechanic, allowing it to be used as a spell in a pinch.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 3. It has multiple abilities and an alternative casting cost, but none of these are particularly complex or difficult to understand.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The flavor text and the mechanics of the card align well. The idea of a volcanic spirit causing destruction as it enters the battlefield is well represented by the damage to non-flying creatures, and the Mountainwalk ability fits with the theme of a creature born from a volcano.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It is well-designed, with a good balance of power, complexity, and flavor.
