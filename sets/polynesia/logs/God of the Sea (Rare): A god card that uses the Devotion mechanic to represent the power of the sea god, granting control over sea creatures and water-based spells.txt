**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

God of the Sea (Rare): A god card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the power of the sea god, granting control over sea creatures and water-based spells. (white card)

# Set Mechanics

White: Focuses on community and protection. Mechanics include Crew and Devotion.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: God of the Sea (Rare): A god card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the power of the sea god, granting control over sea creatures and water-based spells. (white card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

1. "God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five." Similar to Thassa, God of the Sea. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.

8. "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life for each creature you control." Similar to Angel of Vitality. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.

12. "At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, that player sacrifices a creature unless they pay 1 life for each creature they control." Similar to Propaganda. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
God of the Sea can't be blocked as long as your devotion to white is five or more
At the beginning of your end step, if your devotion to white is less than five, exile God of the Sea  Return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step

Design Idea2.
God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five
Vigilance: God of the Sea doesn't tap when it attacks
God of the Sea can't be blocked as long as your devotion to white is five or more
As long as your devotion to white is five or more, God of the Sea has 'When this creature dies, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step

Design Idea3.
God of the Sea can't be blocked as long as your devotion to white is five or more
God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five
Tap: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn
As long as your devotion to white is five or more, God of the Sea has 'When this creature dies, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 7.

Again, the card idea is: God of the Sea (Rare): A god card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the power of the sea god, granting control over sea creatures and water-based spells. (white card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: God of the Sea

Rarity: Rare

Type: Legendary Enchantment Creature - God

Cost: 3WW

Text: 

1. "God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five." (Complexity 1, Flavor 4, Synergy 3)

2. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if your devotion to white is five or more, put a flood counter on target land. As long as that land has a flood counter on it, it's an Island in addition to its other types." (Complexity 3, Flavor 5, Synergy 4)

3. "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life for each creature you control." (Complexity 3, Flavor 3, Synergy 4)

Power/Toughness: 5/5

This design is synergistic because it uses the Devotion mechanic to both protect the God of the Sea and to grant it powerful abilities. The hexproof ability makes it difficult for opponents to remove the God of the Sea from the battlefield, especially in the early game when your devotion to white is likely to be less than five. 

The flood counter ability represents the God of the Sea's control over water and sea creatures. It can turn any land into an Island, which can disrupt your opponent's mana base and potentially enable synergies with other cards in your deck that care about Islands or water.

The life gain ability represents the God of the Sea's protective nature, as it grants you life whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control. This can help you stay alive longer and potentially outlast your opponent.

The total complexity of this card is 7 (1 for the hexproof ability, 3 for the flood counter ability, and 3 for the life gain ability), which is the maximum allowed. The card's flavor and synergy scores are also high, making it a strong and flavorful addition to any deck that can support its white mana cost.

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Card Name: God of the Sea

Rarity: Rare

Type: Legendary Enchantment Creature - God

Cost: 3WW

Text: 

1. "God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five." (Complexity 1, Flavor 4, Synergy 3)

2. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if your devotion to white is five or more, put a flood counter on target land. As long as that land has a flood counter on it, it's an Island in addition to its other types." (Complexity 3, Flavor 5, Synergy 4)

3. "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life for each creature you control." (Complexity 3, Flavor 3, Synergy 4)

Power/Toughness: 5/5

This design is synergistic because it uses the Devotion mechanic to both protect the God of the Sea and to grant it powerful abilities. The hexproof ability makes it difficult for opponents to remove the God of the Sea from the battlefield, especially in the early game when your devotion to white is likely to be less than five. 

The flood counter ability represents the God of the Sea's control over water and sea creatures. It can turn any land into an Island, which can disrupt your opponent's mana base and potentially enable synergies with other cards in your deck that care about Islands or water.

The life gain ability represents the God of the Sea's protective nature, as it grants you life whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control. This can help you stay alive longer and potentially outlast your opponent.

The total complexity of this card is 7 (1 for the hexproof ability, 3 for the flood counter ability, and 3 for the life gain ability), which is the maximum allowed. The card's flavor and synergy scores are also high, making it a strong and flavorful addition to any deck that can support its white mana cost.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
