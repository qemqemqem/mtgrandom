Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcanic Rock (Common): A land card that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana, representing the volatile power of the volcanoes. (colorless card)

# Set Mechanics



Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Volcanic Rock (Common): A land card that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana, representing the volatile power of the volcanoes. (colorless card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. "Tap: Add {C} to your mana pool." Similar to [Wastes]. Complexity 1. Flavor 2. Synergy 5.
2. "Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool." Similar to [Crystal Vein]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
3. "Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped." Similar to [Rugged Highlands]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
4. "When Volcanic Rock is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, deal 1 damage to any target." Similar to [Zektar Shrine Expedition]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 3.
5. "Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast an Elemental spell." Similar to [Unclaimed Territory]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

7. "Remove a pressure counter from Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool." Similar to [Llanowar Reborn]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
8. "Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R} for each pressure counter on it." Similar to [Blast Zone]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
9. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if Volcanic Rock has a pressure counter on it, put a pressure counter on it." Similar to [Thing in the Ice]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
10. "When Volcanic Rock is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it deals damage equal to the number of pressure counters on it to any target." Similar to [Blast Zone]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

I need help generating a Magic the Gathering card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcanic Rock (Common): A land card that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana, representing the volatile power of the volcanoes. (colorless card)

Here's what its colors are like in the set:



# Mechanics

I have some ideas for mechanics, but I'm not sure which ones to use. Here are some mechanics I'm considering:

"Tap: Add {C} to your mana pool." Similar to [Wastes]. Complexity 1. Flavor 2. Synergy 5.
"Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool." Similar to [Crystal Vein]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped." Similar to [Rugged Highlands]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When Volcanic Rock is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, deal 1 damage to any target." Similar to [Zektar Shrine Expedition]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 3.
"Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast an Elemental spell." Similar to [Unclaimed Territory]. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"When Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield, you may pay {2}. If you do, it enters the battlefield with a pressure counter on it." Similar to [Llanowar Reborn]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"Remove a pressure counter from Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool." Similar to [Llanowar Reborn]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R} for each pressure counter on it." Similar to [Blast Zone]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"At the beginning of your upkeep, if Volcanic Rock has a pressure counter on it, put a pressure counter on it." Similar to [Thing in the Ice]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
"When Volcanic Rock is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, it deals damage equal to the number of pressure counters on it to any target." Similar to [Blast Zone]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Tap: Add {C} to your mana pool
Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool

Design Idea2.
Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped
When Volcanic Rock is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, deal 1 damage to any target

Design Idea3.
When Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield, you may pay {2}  If you do, it enters the battlefield with a pressure counter on it



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Volcanic Rock (Common): A land card that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana, representing the volatile power of the volcanoes. (colorless card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Volcanic Rock

Land (Common)

Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped.

Tap: Add {C} to your mana pool.

Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool.

This design is synergistic because it combines the simplicity of a land that enters the battlefield tapped with the versatility of a land that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana. The first mechanic is common in many Magic the Gathering sets, making it familiar to players and easy to understand. The second mechanic adds a layer of strategic depth, allowing players to trade long-term mana production for a short-term burst of mana, which can be crucial in certain situations. 

The sacrifice mechanic also fits well with the flavor of the card, representing the volatile power of a volcano that can erupt for a sudden burst of energy. The colorless mana produced by the tap ability represents the stable, dormant state of the volcano, while the red mana produced by the sacrifice ability represents the explosive, destructive power of an eruption. 

This design has a total complexity of 2, making it accessible to players of all skill levels while still offering interesting strategic options.

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Volcanic Rock (Common): A land card that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana, representing the volatile power of the volcanoes. (colorless card)

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Volcanic Rock

Land (Common)

Volcanic Rock enters the battlefield tapped.

Tap: Add {C} to your mana pool.

Sacrifice Volcanic Rock: Add {R}{R} to your mana pool.

This design is synergistic because it combines the simplicity of a land that enters the battlefield tapped with the versatility of a land that can be sacrificed for a burst of mana. The first mechanic is common in many Magic the Gathering sets, making it familiar to players and easy to understand. The second mechanic adds a layer of strategic depth, allowing players to trade long-term mana production for a short-term burst of mana, which can be crucial in certain situations.

This design has a total complexity of 2, making it accessible to players of all skill levels while still offering interesting strategic options.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
