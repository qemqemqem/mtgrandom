**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Spirit Shield (Common): An enchantment card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the protection granted by the gods. (white card)

# Set Mechanics

White: Focuses on community and protection. Mechanics include Crew and Devotion.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Spirit Shield (Common): An enchantment card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the protection granted by the gods. (white card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. "Enchanted creature gains Lifelink." Similar to Daybreak Coronet. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
2. "Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each white symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control." Similar to Ethereal Armor. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
3. "Enchanted creature has Vigilance." Similar to Sentinel's Eyes. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
4. "Enchanted creature has First Strike." Similar to Chosen by Heliod. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
5. "Enchanted creature has Protection from a color of your choice." Similar to Spectra Ward. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

6. "When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, draw a card." Similar to Eidolon of Blossoms. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
7. "When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, you gain life equal to your devotion to white." Similar to Gray Merchant of Asphodel. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
8. "When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Spirit Shield leaves the battlefield." Similar to Banishing Light. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
9. "At the beginning of your upkeep, if your devotion to white is more than 3, put a +1/+1 counter on enchanted creature." Similar to Archetype of Courage. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
10. "When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, enchanted creature gains indestructible until end of turn." Similar to Ajani's Presence. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
Enchanted creature has Vigilance
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each white symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control

Design Idea2.
Enchanted creature has Vigilance
Enchanted creature has Protection from a color of your choice

Design Idea3.
When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, enchanted creature gains indestructible until end of turn



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Spirit Shield (Common): An enchantment card that uses the Devotion mechanic to represent the protection granted by the gods. (white card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Spirit Shield
Enchantment - Aura (Common)
Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each white symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control.
When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, you gain life equal to your devotion to white.

This design is synergistic because it encourages a mono-white strategy, rewarding the player for having a high number of white mana symbols among the permanents they control. The +1/+1 boost to the enchanted creature is a direct representation of the gods' favor, making the creature stronger the more you are devoted to white. The life gain mechanic when the enchantment enters the battlefield is a nice bonus that further emphasizes the protective aspect of the card, providing a potential swing in life totals that can turn the tide of a game. The complexity of this card is 3, which is manageable for most players and fits within the common rarity.

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Spirit Shield
Enchantment - Aura (Common)
Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each white symbol in the mana costs of permanents you control.
When Spirit Shield enters the battlefield, if your devotion to white is more than 3, you gain life equal to your devotion to white.

The complexity of this card is 3, which is manageable for most players and fits within the common rarity.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
