**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Island Navigator",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Human, Cleric",
    "power": "1",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "When this creature crews a Vehicle, you may tap target creature.\nWhen this creature crews a Vehicle, gain 2 life.",
    "flavor_text": "The sea is a treacherous mistress, but under my guidance, we will find our way.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{W}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Island Navigator" could be "Veteran Motorist" and "Depala, Pilot Exemplar" as they also have abilities that trigger when crewing a Vehicle.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The card's text makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around 2. It's not particularly strong, but it has some utility in a deck that uses Vehicles. It's a bit weak for a common, but not unplayably so.

* The complexity of the card is around 2. It's not overly complex, but the crewing mechanic and the triggered abilities add some complexity.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is around 3. The idea of a navigator who can tap creatures (presumably by guiding the vehicle to ram into them or distract them) and who gains life (presumably from the safety of being in a vehicle) is interesting and fits the mechanics well.

Overall, the card "Island Navigator" looks good. It's a bit on the weak side for a common, but it's not unplayably weak, and it has some interesting mechanics and flavor.
