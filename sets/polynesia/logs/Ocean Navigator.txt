**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Ocean Navigator",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Human Sailor",
    "power": "2",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "Ocean Navigator gets +1/+1 as long as you control an Island.\nWhenever Ocean Navigator deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card.",
    "flavor_text": "The sea whispers secrets to those who know how to listen.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{U}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Ocean Navigator" include "Curiosity" and "Lorescale Coatl". These cards also have abilities that allow you to draw a card when dealing combat damage or when you draw a card.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around 3. It's a solid common card that can be quite powerful in the right deck, but it's not overpowered.

* The complexity of the card is around 2. It has a couple of abilities, but they are straightforward and easy to understand.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 4. The idea of a sailor navigating the ocean and gaining strength from the presence of an Island is well reflected in the mechanics. The ability to draw cards can be seen as the sailor discovering new routes or secrets.

Overall, the card "Ocean Navigator" looks good. It's a well-designed card that fits well within the game's mechanics and flavor.
