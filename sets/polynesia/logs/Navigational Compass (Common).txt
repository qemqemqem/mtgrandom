# Set Mechanics



Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".

Again, the idea for the card is: Navigational Compass (Common): An artifact that allows you to scry, representing the careful planning and foresight needed in navigation. (colorless card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

1. "Tap: Scry 1." Similar to [Treasure Map]. Complexity 1. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
2. "When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, scry 1." Similar to [Omen of the Sea]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.
3. "Whenever you cast a spell, you may pay 1. If you do, scry 1." Similar to [Thassa, God of the Sea]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.

7. "Tap, Pay 1 life: Scry 1." Similar to [Read the Runes]. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 5.

10. "At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't play a land this turn, you may scry 1." Similar to [Path of Ancestry]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

11. "Tap, Sacrifice a land: Scry 2." Similar to [Seer's Sundial]. Complexity 4. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
12. "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may pay 2. If you do, scry 1." Similar to [Lifecrafter's Bestiary]. Complexity 4. Flavor 2. Synergy 4.
13. "Whenever you cast a spell of the chosen type, scry 1." Similar to [Mystic Forge]. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 5.
14. "Whenever you scry, you may pay 2. If you do, draw a card." Similar to [Riverwise Augur]. Complexity 5. Flavor 4. Synergy 5.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, scry 1
Tap: Scry 1

Design Idea2.
When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, look at the top card of your library  You may put that card on the bottom of your library

Design Idea3.
Sacrifice Navigational Compass: Scry 2
Tap: Scry 1
When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, scry 1



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 2 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 3.

Again, the card idea is: Navigational Compass (Common): An artifact that allows you to scry, representing the careful planning and foresight needed in navigation. (colorless card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Navigational Compass

Artifact (Common)

When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, scry 1.

Tap: Scry 1.

This design is simple yet effective, and it fits well with the theme of a navigational compass. The "enters the battlefield" mechanic represents the initial use of the compass, giving you a glimpse of what's to come. The tap mechanic represents the ongoing use of the compass, allowing you to continually adjust your course as needed. 

This design has a total complexity of 2, which is appropriate for a common card. It's also highly synergistic, as both mechanics revolve around the scry mechanic, allowing you to manipulate your deck and plan your future turns. 

The flavor of the card is also strong, as it represents the careful planning and foresight needed in navigation. The scry mechanic is a perfect representation of this, as it allows you to look ahead and plan your future moves. 

Overall, this design is simple, flavorful, and synergistic, making it a great addition to any deck that values deck manipulation and planning.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.

    "name": "Navigational Compass",
    "supertype": "Artifact",
    "subtype": "",
