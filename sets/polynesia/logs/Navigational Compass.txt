**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Navigational Compass",
    "supertype": "Artifact",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "When Navigational Compass enters the battlefield, scry 1.\n{T}: Scry 1.",
    "flavor_text": "The path ahead is never as clear as the journey behind.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Navigational Compass" include "Treasure Map" and "Crystal Ball". Both of these cards have abilities that allow the player to scry.

* The card is not missing any important details. It's an artifact, not a creature, so it doesn't need power or toughness. The mana cost is provided.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says. When it enters the battlefield, you get to scry 1, and you can tap it to scry 1.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 2. It's not particularly strong, but the ability to scry can be useful in certain situations. It's a decent common.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 1. It's very simple, with only one mechanic (scry) that is straightforward to understand.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 3. The flavor text matches the mechanics of the card well, suggesting the idea of looking ahead and planning your next move, which is what scrying allows you to do. However, it's not particularly exciting or unique.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a simple, functional common that fits well within the game's mechanics and flavor.
