**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Spirit's Call",
    "supertype": "Instant",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. If a creature died this turn, you may pay {1}{B} instead. If you've cast another black spell this turn, you may return an additional creature card from your graveyard to your hand.",
    "flavor_text": "The spirits of the fallen heed the call, ready to serve once more.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{B}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Spirit's Call" include "Grim Discovery" and "Gravedigger". Both of these cards involve returning a creature card from your graveyard to your hand.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness as it's not a creature.

* The text on the card does make sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 3. It's a common card that has a decent effect, but it's not overly powerful. It's conditional and requires setup to get the most value out of it.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 3. It has a few different conditions that can change how the card is played, but it's not overly complex.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The flavor text matches well with the mechanics of the card, and the idea of spirits returning to serve again fits well with the black color identity in MTG.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a solid common card with a good balance of power, complexity, and flavor.

Full: # Brainstorming

Central Figure: A spectral figure, possibly a ghost or spirit

Source Material: Original concept
Action: The spirit is reaching out, as if calling or beckoning to someone or something unseen.
Background Details: The setting is a dark, misty forest at night. The only light comes from the spirit itself and the moon, casting long, eerie shadows. The weather is calm but the atmosphere is tense.

# Decision

The card art will depict an ethereal spirit in a dark, misty forest. The spirit is glowing, casting long shadows on the surrounding trees. It is reaching out, as if calling to someone or something unseen. The forest is a mix of Celtic and Japanese influences, with cherry blossom trees adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome scene. The overall atmosphere is mysterious and tense.
