**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Verdant Blessing" include "Rampant Growth" and "Harrow". Both of these cards allow you to search your library for a basic land card and put it onto the battlefield.

* The card is not missing any important details. It's not a creature, so it doesn't need power and toughness. The mana cost is clearly stated.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says. However, the Landfall ability is typically found on permanents, not instants. This could cause some confusion as the Landfall ability would only be relevant during the turn this card is played. 

* The card is mostly written in the right style for MTG. However, the Landfall ability is typically written as "Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, [effect]." In this case, it would be "Landfall — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 3 life." 

* Power Level: 2. The card is not particularly strong, but it does provide a small amount of ramp and life gain, which can be useful in certain decks.

* Complexity: 2. The card is fairly simple, but the Landfall ability adds a bit of complexity.

* Flavor: 4. The flavor of the card matches the mechanics well. The idea of a verdant blessing bringing life (in the form of life gain) and fertility (in the form of land ramp) is well executed.

In conclusion, the card mostly looks good, but it needs work on the mechanical issues and style related to the Landfall ability.

**** STEP IMPROVED CARD ****

** PROMPT **

Given your feedback, please try to improve the card. Please output JSON for the improved card.

Here are some other mechanics we could consider for the card, if we really need to change it based on that criticism:

"If you control a Forest, you may play Verdant Blessing without paying its mana cost." Similar to Allosaurus Shepherd. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"If Verdant Blessing was kicked, instead search your library for two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield tapped." Similar to Vastwood Surge. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, gain 3 life." Similar to Feed the Clan. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
"If Verdant Blessing is in your graveyard, you may pay 2G and exile it: Search your library for a basic land card and put it onto the battlefield tapped." Similar to Life from the Loam. Complexity 2. Flavor 4. Synergy 4.
"If you control more lands than each opponent, Verdant Blessing costs 1 less to cast." Similar to Might of the Masses. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, if you control three or more other green permanents, draw a card." Similar to Glimpse of Nature. Complexity 3. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, you may reveal the top card of your library. If it's a land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped." Similar to Courser of Kruphix. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn." Similar to Overrun. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, if it's the second spell you've cast this turn, add GG to your mana pool." Similar to Boreal Druid. Complexity 4. Flavor 3. Synergy 4.
"When you play Verdant Blessing, you may sacrifice a land. If you do, search your library for up to two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield tapped." Similar to Harrow. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.

Here are the details of the card that needs to be fixed, again:

```json
{
    "name": "Verdant Blessing",
    "supertype": "Instant",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library.\nLandfall \u2014 If a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, you gain 3 life.",
    "flavor_text": "The spirits of nature guide you to fertile lands, blessing you with their verdant bounty.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{G}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

** RESPONSE **

Based on your feedback and the mechanics you've suggested, I've decided to replace the Landfall mechanic with a Kicker mechanic. This will add a bit of complexity to the card, but it will also increase its power level and synergy with other cards. Here's the updated card:

```json
{
    "name": "Verdant Blessing",
    "supertype": "Instant",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Kicker {2}{G} (You may pay an additional {2}{G} as you cast this spell.)\nSearch your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library. If Verdant Blessing was kicked, instead search your library for two basic land cards, put them onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library.",
    "flavor_text": "The spirits of nature guide you to fertile lands, blessing you with their verdant bounty.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{G}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

This version of the card allows the player to search for two basic land cards instead of one if they pay the kicker cost. This increases the card's power level and synergy with other cards, while also adding a bit of complexity. The flavor of the card remains the same, as the spirits of nature are still guiding the player to fertile lands.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Verdant Blessing" include "Rampant Growth" and "Explosive Vegetation". Both of these cards allow the player to search their library for basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield.

* The card is not missing any important details. It's not a creature, so it doesn't need power and toughness. The mana cost is clearly stated.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says. The kicker mechanic is a well-established part of MTG, and the card's effects are clearly explained.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. It uses standard terminology and phrasing, and a judge should have no trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 3. It's a solid common card that can help a player ramp up their mana, especially if they can afford the kicker cost. However, it's not particularly powerful or game-changing.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 2. It's fairly straightforward, with only the kicker mechanic adding a bit of complexity.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The flavor text ties in well with the card's mechanics, evoking the idea of nature spirits guiding the player to fertile lands. The name "Verdant Blessing" also fits well with the card's effects.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a well-designed common card that fits within the power and complexity levels expected for its rarity, and it has a strong flavor that matches its mechanics.
