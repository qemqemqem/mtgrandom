**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Jungle Explorer",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Human Scout",
    "power": "2",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "Landfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Jungle Explorer.\nWhen Jungle Explorer enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.",
    "flavor_text": "Every step into the unknown strengthens my resolve.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{G}",
    "rarity": "Common",
    "color": "Green"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Jungle Explorer" include "Tireless Tracker" and "Rampaging Baloths" which both have landfall abilities that put +1/+1 counters on them. "Sakura-Tribe Elder" is another card that allows you to search your library for a basic land card.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power, and toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around a 3. It's a solid common card that can grow in power with landfall, but it's not overly powerful.

* The complexity of the card is around a 2. It has a couple of abilities, but they are straightforward and easy to understand.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 4. The idea of a jungle explorer growing stronger as they explore (i.e., as more lands enter the battlefield) is well reflected in the mechanics.

Overall, the card "Jungle Explorer" looks good. It's a well-designed card that fits within the power and complexity levels for a common card, and it has a strong flavor that matches its mechanics.
