**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Spirit of the Canopy",
    "supertype": "Creature",
    "subtype": "Spirit",
    "power": "2",
    "toughness": "2",
    "rule_text": "Reach\nLandfall - Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Spirit of the Canopy.\nWhenever Spirit of the Canopy deals combat damage to a player, you may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.",
    "flavor_text": "A powerful tree spirit that draws strength from the vastness of the jungle.",
    "mana_cost": "{2}{G}",
    "rarity": "Uncommon"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Spirit of the Canopy" include "Undergrowth Champion" and "Oran-Rief Hydra", both of which also have landfall abilities that put +1/+1 counters on them.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power, and toughness, which are all necessary for a creature card.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says. The abilities are clear and follow the rules of the game.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. It uses standard terminology and phrasing, and a judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around a 4. It's a strong card for an uncommon, with the potential to become quite powerful if the player has a lot of land cards. However, it's not overpowered as it requires specific conditions (landfall and dealing combat damage) to fully utilize its abilities.

* The complexity of the card is around a 3. It has multiple abilities, but they are straightforward and easy to understand.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 5. The card's abilities and flavor text create a clear image of a tree spirit that grows stronger with the land, which fits well with the green mana and landfall mechanic.

Overall, the card "Spirit of the Canopy" looks good. It's a well-designed card that fits its rarity, has clear and interesting mechanics, and has a strong flavor that matches its abilities.
