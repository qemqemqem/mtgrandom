**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "The Great Canoe",
    "supertype": "Artifact",
    "subtype": "Vehicle",
    "power": "5",
    "toughness": "5",
    "rule_text": "Crew 4 (Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 4 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn)\nWhenever The Great Canoe becomes crewed, draw a card.\nWhenever The Great Canoe deals combat damage to a player, you may exile target nonland permanent that player controls.",
    "flavor_text": "A symbol of unity and strength, navigating through the vast and treacherous oceans.",
    "mana_cost": "{5}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "The Great Canoe" include "Skysovereign, Consul Flagship" and "Smuggler's Copter", both of which are Vehicle artifacts with abilities that trigger when they become crewed or deal combat damage.

* The card is not missing any important details. It has a mana cost, power, and toughness, which are all necessary for an Artifact Vehicle.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. The crew mechanic is a standard one for Vehicles, and the triggered abilities are clear and possible to execute.

* The card is written in the correct style for MTG. The rules text is clear and would not cause confusion for a judge.

* Power Level: 4. The Great Canoe is a strong card, but not overly so. It requires a significant crew to operate, and while its abilities are powerful, they are not game-breaking. 

* Complexity: 3. The card is moderately complex, with multiple triggered abilities and the crew mechanic, but it is not overly complicated.

* Flavor: 4. The flavor of the card is strong, with the idea of a powerful, crewed vehicle being well represented by the mechanics. The ability to exile a nonland permanent could be seen as the canoe navigating treacherous waters and overcoming obstacles.

Overall, the card "Looks good". It is well-designed, with a good balance of power, complexity, and flavor.
