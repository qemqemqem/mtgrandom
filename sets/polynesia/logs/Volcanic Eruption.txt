**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "Volcanic Eruption",
    "supertype": "Instant",
    "subtype": "",
    "power": "",
    "toughness": "",
    "rule_text": "Volcanic Eruption deals 2 damage to any target. Landfall \u2014 If a land entered the battlefield under your control this turn, Volcanic Eruption deals 3 damage to that target instead.",
    "flavor_text": "The mountain's fury knows no bounds.",
    "mana_cost": "{1}{R}",
    "rarity": "Common"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "Volcanic Eruption" include "Shock" and "Lightning Bolt". Both are instant spells that deal damage to any target, though they lack the landfall mechanic.

* The card is not missing any important details. It's not a creature, so it doesn't need power and toughness. The mana cost is provided.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It's possible to do what the card says. The landfall mechanic is a well-established one in MTG.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* Power Level: I would rate this card a 3. It's a common card with a decent effect, but it's not overly powerful. The landfall mechanic adds a bit of versatility and potential for increased damage, but it's conditional.

* Complexity: I would rate this card a 2. It's fairly simple, with only one effect and one additional conditional effect. The landfall mechanic adds a bit of complexity, but it's a well-known mechanic that most players should be familiar with.

* Flavor: I would rate this card a 4. The name and effect match well, and the flavor text adds to the theme of a volcanic eruption. The landfall mechanic also fits the theme, as it suggests the eruption is more powerful when a land (presumably a mountain) enters the battlefield.

Overall, this card "Looks good". It's a well-designed common card with a clear theme and mechanics that match.

** RESPONSE **

Prompt: Volcanic Eruption, original, Magic the Gathering art, spec art, a mage harnesses the power of an erupting volcano, dramatic, intense, in the style of Romanticism and Japanese ukiyo-e, bold colors, dynamic lines, by Yoshitaka Amano and J.M.W. Turner

Artist: Yoshitaka Amano, J.M.W. Turner

Full: # Brainstorming

Central Figure: A powerful mage harnessing the energy of a volcanic eruption
Character Details: The mage is of ambiguous ethnicity, with dark, flowing hair and eyes that glow with the same fiery intensity as the volcano. They are wearing a robe adorned with symbols of fire and earth, and their expression is one of intense concentration.
Source Material: This card is not based on an existing story or media.
Action: The mage is channeling the raw, destructive power of the volcano, their hands raised as if to command the eruption itself.
Background Details: The scene is set at the foot of a massive, erupting volcano, with lava and ash spewing into the sky. The lighting is dramatic, with the glow of the lava casting long, ominous shadows. The weather is stormy, with lightning crackling in the ash-filled sky.
Culture: The culture is inspired by ancient civilizations that lived near volcanoes and revered them as gods, such as the Minoans of ancient Crete. The artist should depict this influence subtly, perhaps through the symbols on the mage's robe or the architecture of any visible buildings.
Style: Romanticism, with its emphasis on emotion and the sublime power of nature; Japanese ukiyo-e, with its bold lines and dramatic compositions.
Medium: Bold, vibrant colors; dynamic lines; high contrast.
Fantasy Artist: Yoshitaka Amano, H.R. Giger
Historical Artist: J.M.W. Turner, Katsushika Hokusai

# Decision

The card art will depict a mage at the foot of an erupting volcano, their hands raised as they channel its raw, destructive power. The scene is dramatic and intense, with the glow of the lava casting long shadows and lightning crackling in the ash-filled sky. The mage's robe is adorned with symbols inspired by ancient civilizations that revered volcanoes, adding a layer of cultural depth to the image.
