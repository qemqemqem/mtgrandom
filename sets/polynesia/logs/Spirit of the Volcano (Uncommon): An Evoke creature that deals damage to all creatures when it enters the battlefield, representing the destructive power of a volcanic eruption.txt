**** STEP SUGGESTED MECHANICS ****

** PROMPT **

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Spirit of the Volcano (Uncommon): An Evoke creature that deals damage to all creatures when it enters the battlefield, representing the destructive power of a volcanic eruption. (red card)

# Set Mechanics

Red: Focuses on passion and chaos. Mechanics include Evoke and Mountainwalk.


Based on this set description, what would be synergistic abilities for this card to have?

# Brainstorming

I want you to brainstorm 15 possible mechanics for this card. 

For each possible mechanic, write a short description of how it would work, as though you were writing Oracle text for the card, like "when this card enters the battlefield, its controller draws a card". Mention a card that has this mechanic, if you can think of one. 

Then, rate the complexity of the mechanic on a scale from 1-5. 1 is simple, like a common keyword, like "Flying" or "Haste". 3 is an unusual ability, like unblockable or hexproof. 5 is a very complex ability that requires a lot of rules text.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the flavor of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the flavor at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the flavor.

Then, rate how well the mechanic supports the mechanical archetype of the card on a scale from 1-5. 1 means the mechanic doesn't support the archetype at all. 5 means the mechanic is a perfect fit for the archetype.

First, generate 5 simple mechanics, complexity 1-2, like "Hexproof" or "Lifelink".
Then, generate 5 medium complexity mechanics, complexity 2-4, like "When this creature enters the battlefield, draw a card".
Then, generate 5 complex or weird mechanics that might take 1 or 2 lines of rules text, complexity 4-5.

Again, the idea for the card is: Spirit of the Volcano (Uncommon): An Evoke creature that deals damage to all creatures when it enters the battlefield, representing the destructive power of a volcanic eruption. (red card)

Put each possible mechanic on its own line, like this:

1. Text of the mechanic. Similar to [Card]. Complexity X. Flavor X. Synergy X.

** RESPONSE **

Simple Mechanics:

1. Haste. Similar to [Goblin Guide]. Complexity 1. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
2. First Strike. Similar to [Goblin Chieftain]. Complexity 1. Flavor 2. Synergy 2.
3. Trample. Similar to [Ball Lightning]. Complexity 1. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
4. Can't be blocked except by two or more creatures. Similar to [Menace]. Complexity 2. Flavor 3. Synergy 2.
5. When this creature dies, it deals 1 damage to any target. Similar to [Mogg Fanatic]. Complexity 2. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.

Medium Complexity Mechanics:

6. When this creature enters the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to each opponent. Similar to [Fanatic of Mogis]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 4.
7. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a Mountain. If you do, it deals 2 damage to any target. Similar to [Embermaw Hellion]. Complexity 3. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
8. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card. Similar to [Rummaging Goblin]. Complexity 3. Flavor 2. Synergy 3.
9. When this creature dies, you may put it on the bottom of its owner's library. Similar to [Worldspine Wurm]. Complexity 3. Flavor 4. Synergy 3.
10. Whenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+0 until end of turn for each Mountain you control. Similar to [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.

Complex Mechanics:

11. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of Mountains. For each Mountain sacrificed this way, it deals 1 damage to each creature. Similar to [Akoum Hellkite]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
12. When this creature enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature without flying. Similar to [Earthquake]. Complexity 4. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
13. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may pay {R}. If you do, it deals 2 damage to each creature. Similar to [Pyroclasm]. Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
14. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may exile it. If you do, it deals 3 damage to each creature and each player. Similar to [Blightning]. Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.
15. When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice it. If you do, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature and each player. Similar to [Fireball]. Complexity 5. Flavor 5. Synergy 5.

# Possible Card Ideas

I want the card to use a few of these mechanics, in a nice combination that's flavorful and synergistic. I was thinking something like this:

Design Idea1.
When this creature enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature without flying

Design Idea2.
When this creature dies, it deals 1 damage to any target
When this creature enters the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to each opponent

Design Idea3.
When this creature enters the battlefield, you may pay {R}  If you do, it deals 2 damage to each creature



I'm worried that these mechanics might be too complicated.

# Final Card Design

Can you think about those mechanics and the designs I've thought of, and come up with the final best set of mechanics for this card? Explain why the design you've chosen is synergistic.

The card should have no more than 3 mechanics, and should have a total complexity of no more than 5.

Again, the card idea is: Spirit of the Volcano (Uncommon): An Evoke creature that deals damage to all creatures when it enters the battlefield, representing the destructive power of a volcanic eruption. (red card)

Please think about the design and then say "# Final Card" and then give a card design.

** RESPONSE **

# Final Card

Card Name: Spirit of the Volcano

Card Type: Creature - Elemental Spirit

Rarity: Uncommon

Cost: 3RR

Power/Toughness: 4/4

Mechanics:

1. Evoke 1RR (You may cast this spell for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.)
2. When Spirit of the Volcano enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature without flying.
3. Mountainwalk (This creature can't be blocked as long as defending player controls a Mountain.)

Flavor Text: "Its arrival is heralded by the earth's trembling rage, its departure by the silence of the scorched."

This design is synergistic because it combines the Evoke mechanic with a powerful enter-the-battlefield effect, allowing the player to choose between a powerful, one-time effect or a strong creature with evasion. The Mountainwalk mechanic is a nod to the card's volcanic theme and also synergizes well with the card's enter-the-battlefield effect, as it can potentially clear the way for an unblockable attack. The total complexity of this card is 5, with Evoke being complexity 2, the damage effect being complexity 2, and Mountainwalk being complexity 1.

Please generate a card. Here is the idea I have for it: 

Spirit of the Volcano (Uncommon): An Evoke creature that deals damage to all creatures when it enters the battlefield, representing the destructive power of a volcanic eruption. (red card)

And here is the mechanical design I want for the card:

# Final Card

Card Name: Spirit of the Volcano

Card Type: Creature - Elemental Spirit

Rarity: Uncommon

Power/Toughness: 4/4

Mechanics:

1. Evoke 1RR (You may cast this spell for its evoke cost. If you do, it's sacrificed when it enters the battlefield.)
2. When Spirit of the Volcano enters the battlefield, it deals damage equal to its power to each creature without flying.
3. Mountainwalk (This creature can't be blocked as long as defending player controls a Mountain.)

This design is synergistic because it combines the Evoke mechanic with a powerful enter-the-battlefield effect, allowing the player to choose between a powerful, one-time effect or a strong creature with evasion. The Mountainwalk mechanic is a nod to the card's volcanic theme and also synergizes well with the card's enter-the-battlefield effect, as it can potentially clear the way for an unblockable attack. The total complexity of this card is 5, with Evoke being complexity 2, the damage effect being complexity 2, and Mountainwalk being complexity 1.

First, decide on the mana cost for the card, unless it's a land. 

Then, decide on the card's power and toughness, if it's a creature.

Make sure you know it's supertype and subtype, as well as its rarity and name. 

If it's a planeswalker or other card type, decide on any other attributes it needs.

Make sure the card mechanics are in oracle text.

Finally, in the same JSON format that you showed me above, write out the full details of the card.
