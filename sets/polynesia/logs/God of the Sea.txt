**** STEP PLEASE CRITICIZE CARD ****

** PROMPT **

I want help designing a Magic the Gathering card. Here are the details:

```json
{
    "name": "God of the Sea",
    "supertype": "Legendary Enchantment Creature",
    "subtype": "God",
    "power": "5",
    "toughness": "5",
    "rule_text": "God of the Sea has hexproof as long as your devotion to white is less than five.\nAt the beginning of your upkeep, if your devotion to white is five or more, put a flood counter on target land. As long as that land has a flood counter on it, it's an Island in addition to its other types.\nWhenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life for each creature you control.",
    "flavor_text": "The sea is a force to be reckoned with, and so is its god.",
    "mana_cost": "{3}{W}{W}",
    "rarity": "Rare"
}
```

Please answer these questions about this card, and give constructive criticism:

* Name one or two cards that are mechanically similar to this card, for reference.

* Is it missing any important details like mana cost, or power and toughness if it's a creature? If so, write "Needs work: Missing details" and write what's missing

* Does the text on the card make sense mechanically? Is it possible to do what the card says? If not, write "Needs work: Mechanical Issues"

* Is it written in the right style for MTG? Would a judge have trouble interpreting it? If it's not written in the style of Oracle text, write "Needs work: Wrong Style"

Rate the power level of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is unplayable, 1 is very weak, like a bad common, 5 is very strong, like a bomb rare, and 6 is super overpowered like a black lotus. We're aiming for these power levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

Rate the complexity of the card on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is a vanilla creature, 1 is very simple, 5 is very complex, like a planeswalker, and 6 is way too confusingly complicated. We're aiming for these complexity levels:
Commons: 1-3
Uncommons: 2-4
Rares: 3-5

If we're not within those ranges, write "Needs work: Power Level too [high, low]" or "Needs work: [Too complex, too simple]"

Rate the flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics on a scale from 1-5, where 1 is a boring card or a card whose theme is not at all reflected in the mechanics, and 5 is a card with a very interesting theme that is well reflected in the mechanics. If the card is a 1 or a 2, write "Needs work: Flavor".

If the card passes all these tests, then great! Please write "Looks good".

For now, just answer the questions.

** RESPONSE **

* Mechanically similar cards to "God of the Sea" include "Thassa, God of the Sea" and "Heliod, God of the Sun" due to their god subtype and devotion mechanic.

* The card is not missing any important details like mana cost, power, or toughness.

* The text on the card makes sense mechanically. It is possible to do what the card says.

* The card is written in the right style for MTG. A judge would not have trouble interpreting it.

* The power level of the card is around 4. It's strong, but not overly so. It requires a specific board state (devotion to white) to fully utilize its abilities, and its impact is not immediate but rather incremental.

* The complexity of the card is around 4. It has multiple abilities that interact with the game in different ways, and understanding how to best use it requires a good understanding of the game's mechanics.

* The flavor of the card and the match between the flavor and the mechanics is a 4. The theme of a sea god flooding lands and providing life through creatures entering the battlefield is well reflected in the mechanics. However, the connection between the sea god and devotion to white is not immediately clear, which prevents it from being a 5.

Overall, the card "God of the Sea" looks good. It's a well-designed card that fits within the power and complexity levels expected of a rare card, and its flavor is well reflected in its mechanics. However, the connection between the sea god and devotion to white could be made clearer.
